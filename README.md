## Optibook challenge, HackTheBurgh 2023 (1st runner-up out of 15 teams)
### by Year1 - PhoenixRising (team04)

### Information

This is our team's designs for an algorithmic trading bot for the Optibook challenge in HackTheBurgh 2023.

part1 is Pair Trading algorithm, where the algorithm aggressively buys ETFs and sells its component stocks, and vice versa if it can sell for higher than it can buy.

part2 is an incomplete Market Maker algorithm, where the algorithm makes bid and ask orders at the same time to try increase liquidity.

part2 remains incomplete due to time constraints and lethargy during the actual hackathon. In hindsight, it should have been relatively easy to fix the issues in the current version on GitHub, and get it working.

### Instructions

In cloud9, under 'mybots' folder, include main.py, part1-refactored.py, part1-refactored1.py and reset_positions.py

Just run main.py in cloud9 to for it to work.

Come to table 20 for more information or help.
